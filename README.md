# Overwatch Organization

Welcome to the Overwatch Organization â€” a development collective dedicated to building efficient, modular tools for Garry's Mod and beyond. Weâ€™re focused on enabling communities to create immersive and customizable roleplaying experiences with ease.

## ðŸŽ¯ Our Mission

To create lightweight, flexible, and open-source systems that empower developers and server owners to build rich, scalable roleplaying environments without unnecessary complexity or performance overhead.

## ðŸ§± What We Do

- **Framework Development**: We maintain **Overwatch**, a modern, modular Garry's Mod roleplay framework built from the ground up for extensibility and performance.
- **Tooling & Utilities**: We develop utility libraries like our **SQLite Utility**, designed to simplify persistent data handling and reduce the boilerplate in plugin creation.
- **Modular Philosophy**: We emphasize plug-and-play components, encouraging community contributions and easy integration of new features.
- **Open Collaboration**: Our projects are open-source and community-driven. We welcome feedback, feature ideas, and external development.

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Streamline RP server setup and reduce time-to-deploy.
- Promote best practices for clean, maintainable Lua code in Garryâ€™s Mod.
- Foster a developer community built around knowledge sharing and modular design.
- Support diverse roleplay genres through adaptable schemas and plugin architecture.
