# Overwatch Framework (Archived)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This framework has been discontinued and is no longer in active development.**

Overwatch was a modular roleplaying framework for Garry's Mod, built for performance, usability, and extensibility. Development has officially ceased following internal changes, including the departure of a core developer.

## What's Next?

The project has been **rebranded** and **moved** to a new organization:

üîó **New Home:** [Parallax Framework](https://github.com/Parallax-Framework)

* **Rewritten Systems**: Several components will be rewritten from scratch, while others may be reused.
* **Restructured Codebase**: The overall structure and organization of the framework are being redesigned.
* **Same Vision**: Visually and gameplay-wise, the new framework will preserve the original intent and functionality of Overwatch.

## Status

This organization remains available for archival and reference purposes. No further updates or support will be provided here.
